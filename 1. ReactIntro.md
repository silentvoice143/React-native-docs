## React Native

React native is basically used to create android and ios application using react and native components.

React native uses native view of the ios and android. We write code in javascript and it get compiled to native languages which ios and android uses.

## Why React Native?

- Big community : That means lot of libraries and lot of documentation.

- Big companies uses it: such as facebook, shopify etc.

- Cross platform: can make ios and android app . just write it once and compile it for ios and android.

## React Native Internal

- the views which we have written in react get converted into the native view and the logic which is written in js like what happen on click for this we need javascript virtual machine ....javascript core engine used to tell what to do.

- Basically native views+ javascript engine + javascript.

- There is a Bridge called React Native Bridge which translate javascript logic into the native platform understandlble form.

- In general android app is slower than ios because javascriptCore already installed in the ios which powers safari but in android we have to combine the javascriptCore with the compilation .

- To solve this problem facebook launces a optimized javascrip engine
  called hermes.

## Is there CSS in React Native?

In react-native there is no CSS we style our application using javascrip.All of the core components accept a prop named style. The style names and values usually match how CSS works on the web, except names are written using camel casing, e.g. backgroundColor rather than background-color.
